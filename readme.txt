The allies have no difference with the enemies, your party is at the Northwest corner awaiting for your orders.
The move option is buggy, in the best case it will highlight the radius of movement of the chosen ally but sometimes it won't
In those cases select other option and the select move again.

To control the music, click the note icon in the upper left corner of the main screen.
